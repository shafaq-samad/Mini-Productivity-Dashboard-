# 📊 Mini Productivity Dashboard

A single-page **SaaS-style productivity app** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It includes four core productivity tools — **To-Do List, Notes, Pomodoro Timer, and Habit Tracker** — all in one clean and professional dashboard.  
All data is stored in **localStorage**, so your tasks, notes, and habits persist even after refreshing or closing the browser.
